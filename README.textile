A pluggable "GeoDjango":http://geodjango.org/ app of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system. Geography, loosely coupled.

I gave "a talk":https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=ddw9cxb8_36ct9n7kcc in December 2010 about why I think maps should be pluggable.

h2. Features

* A ready-to-serve model set that contains the latest GIS data released by Metro Rail.
* Fragmented rail lines in the government's source file have been consolidated.
* Stops along each line have been connected to stations and lines. This is not done in the government's separate source files.
* Geometry fields are published in three of the most common SRIDs, as well as their source projection.
* Simplified geometry fields that thin down the data for display on a single map.
* A read-only admin for reviewing the data

h2. Requirements

Before you begin, you will need to have a Django project with GeoDjango's 'django.contrib.gis' app installed and configured. The official installation guide is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/. The official tutorial is "here":http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/tutorial/. Both are excellent.

h2. Getting started

h3. 01. Install the source code

You can download it from PyPi.
<pre><code>pip install latimes-pluggablemaps-lametrorail</code></pre>

Or, pull the trunk from github
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/datadesk/latimes-pluggablemaps-lametrorail.git</code></pre>

h3. 02. Install the app in your Django project

In settings.py's INSTALLED_APPS tuple, add the following.
<pre><code>'la_metro_rail',</code></pre>

h3. 03. Create the database tables

From the shell, enter:
<pre><code>python manage.py syncdb</code></pre>

h3. 04. Load the data

From the same shell, enter the following.
<pre><code>python manage.py loadlametrorail</code></pre>

That's it! You now fire up the Django admin or jump in the shell to start playing with the data.
